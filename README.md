# Random Pearson Vectors
A small repo that generates two vectors in a given size and ranges to get a wanted pearson using genetic algorithm (GA).
You can change the hyperparameters of the GA in the "Main" class (see static vars).

### Improvements:
1. Add a crossover operator
2. Add more documentation
